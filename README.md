### Javascript 
   - Basic Data types
     ```
     Primitive Data Type
     1.Boolean
     2.Number
     3.String
     4.null
     5.Undefined
     6.Symbol
     Non-Premitive Data Type
     1.Object
     2.Array
     3.Function
     4.Date
     5.RegExp
     6.Others(set,Map)ES6 only
     
     ```
   - var, let, const
   - ES6 new features
     ```
     1. Array Methods with Chainable Calls:
     Ex. arr.map(),arr.filter()
     2. Spread Operator (...) for In-place Modifications:
     Ex. const num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
         numbers.push(...numbers.map(number => number * 2));
         console.log(numbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] (original array modified)
     3. const and let keywords
     4. Arrow Function
     5. Classes
     6. Enhanced object literals
     7. Template strings
     8. Rest and spread operators
     9. Destructuring
     10. Promises
     Ex: function asyncFun(){
                  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
                        resolve() or reject()
                   })
         }
     
     
     ```
   - Event loop in js
   - OOPs
   - Async Await
   - Hoisting
   - curring
   - setTime out
   - Lexical Scope
   - Scope chain
   - Higher order functions
   - Arrow Function
   - Error Handling
   - Promise  
      <pre style="background-color: #f2f2f2; padding-left: 10px; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
      <code style="color: #C3E8CE; font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono', monospace;">
      A Node.js Promise is a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future,
      allowing us to handle the result of an asynchronous task once it has completed or encountered an error.
      Promises make writing asynchronous code easier. Theyâ€™re an improvement on the callback pattern and very popular in Node.js 
      
       Define a promise: a promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation 
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        console.log("Promise is running");
        setTimeout(() => {
          if (true) {
            resolve("foo");
            reject("rejected");
          }
        }, 300);
      });
      
      myPromise
        .then((value) => {
          return value + " one";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          return value + " two";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          return value + " three";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          return value + " four";
        })
        .then((value) => {
          console.log("Five");
          console.log(value);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          console.log("iamerr", err);
        });
